Certainly great practice for consultants in waiting. \n",

    "This actually happens to be a great reaal-world example: LP and MILP is a vital cog that underpins the electricity market on the Australian eastern seaboard so this kind of project has real world application (although real-life data would be a lot messier)\n",

    "This is a pretty standard request and has no network related constraints. This could be easily solved with Excel or a pen and paper, however this is a good opportunity to set up a linear programming model and see how it works. So lets set it up in our Gurobi package and analyse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly we will import our favourite packages (this assumes that you have gone to the Gurobi website, downloaded the latest version, and obtained the appropriate licence __[https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/)__), and we'll read in the data using pandas. We'll use math later when we need to calculate some distances."
